//! BRC-103/104 Authentication middleware for Cloudflare Workers.
//!
//! This is a 1:1 port of auth-express-middleware, adapted for Cloudflare Workers.
//! It implements BRC-103/104 mutual authentication via BRC-104 HTTP headers.
//!
//! ## Key differences from Express:
//! - Express uses response hijacking (intercepting res.send/json). Workers can't do this.
//! - Instead, we provide `sign_response()` which users call before returning a response.
//! - Express uses in-memory SessionManager. Workers use KV for persistence.
//! - Express delegates all protocol logic to `Peer`. We implement it directly (same logic).
//! - **Replay protection (hardening divergence):** the TS reference
//!   (`@bsv/sdk` `Peer.processGeneralMessage`, verified through v2.0.13)
//!   never records consumed per-request nonces, so a byte-identical signed
//!   request replays successfully there for the whole session lifetime. This
//!   crate consumes `(session_nonce, x-bsv-auth-nonce)` through
//!   [`SessionStorage::try_consume_nonce`] after signature verification and
//!   rejects duplicates with `401 ERR_REPLAYED_REQUEST`.
//!
//! ## Residual replay window (precise statement)
//!
//! With the default Cloudflare-KV-backed storage ([`KvSessionStorage`]):
//! 1. A replay arriving at the **same Cloudflare location** after the
//!    original nonce write completed is always rejected; concurrent
//!    in-flight duplicates at that location can race the KV read-then-write
//!    (sub-second window, no atomic put-if-absent in KV).
//! 2. A replay arriving at a **different location** may succeed at most once
//!    per location until the KV write propagates (≤ ~60 seconds after the
//!    original request).
//! 3. Nonce records expire after `session_ttl_seconds`. A session kept alive
//!    past that by the sliding liveness refresh can therefore accept a
//!    replay of a request **older than `session_ttl_seconds`** — i.e. replay
//!    of a captured request is rejected for at least the full session TTL,
//!    and forever unless the victim's session is still alive when the record
//!    lapses.
//!
//! A strongly consistent `SessionStorage` implementation (Durable Object
//! SQLite put-if-absent) eliminates windows 1 and 2 entirely; retaining
//! nonce records for the whole session lifetime eliminates window 3.
//!
//! ## Refusals are the middleware's own 401 (0.4.1)
//!
//! Every authentication refusal `process_auth*` decides is an
//! `Ok(AuthResult::Response(..))`: status 401, the body
//! `{"status":"error","code":..,"description":..}` (the reference's `message`
//! field for `UNAUTHORIZED`), the CORS headers, unsigned (there is no session
//! to sign with). The codes: `UNAUTHORIZED` (no auth headers),
//! `ERR_SESSION_NOT_FOUND` (no session for the nonce or identity named),
//! `ERR_INVALID_AUTH` (the header's identity is not the session's; the
//! signature is missing or wrong; the session never completed its handshake;
//! a general message without its per-request nonce; headers that do not form
//! a BRC-103 message; a handshake message refused), `ERR_REPLAYED_REQUEST`
//! (the per-request nonce already used). `Err` is a fault only: storage, the
//! server's own key, the transport, the SDK. 0.4.0 raised three of the
//! refusals as `Err(AuthCloudflareError::InvalidAuthentication(..))`, which
//! every host rendered as a generic 500, and the clients that re-handshake
//! on 401 only (`AuthFetch` among them) never recovered a stale session.
//!
//! ## Usage:
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let auth_result = process_auth(req, &env, &options).await?;
//! let (ctx, req, session, body) = match auth_result {
//!     AuthResult::Authenticated { context, request, session, body } => (context, request, session, body),
//!     AuthResult::Response(resp) => return Ok(resp),
//! };
//!
//! // Your handler
//! let response = handle_request(req, &ctx).await?;
//!
//! // Sign the response before returning (required for BRC-103/104 interop)
//! let signed = sign_response(response, &session)?;
//! Ok(signed)
//! ```
