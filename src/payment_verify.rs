//! BRC-29 payment verification before internalize: the Workers adapter over
//! `bsv_middleware_core`.
//!
//! The rules live in the core: the pays-us-correctly check
//! ([`bsv_middleware_core::brc29`]), the streaming reader's validity and
//! spends, the proof's presence and the SPV decision
//! ([`bsv_middleware_core::payment_verify`], [`bsv_middleware_core::spv`]),
//! and the six-word verdict ([`PaymentVerdict`]). This module keeps what is
//! bound to this runtime and to the 0.3 API:
//!
//! - [`UrlHeaderService`]: the core's [`HeaderService`] over a
//!   ChainTracks-compatible base URL fetched with Workers `fetch`, behind the
//!   0.3.6 configuration gate (below);
//! - [`PaymentVerifyError`], the 0.3 error type, and [`accept_verdict`], the
//!   one visible match that maps the core's words onto it;
//! - the 0.3 functions, name for name and signature for signature, and
//!   [`verify_brc29_payment_verified`] (0.5.0), which hands back the
//!   subject's txid beside the amount.
//!
//! ## A payment of any size (0.5.0)
//!
//! The payment is read ONCE through the streaming reader of bsv-rs 0.4 (0.4.1 at least)
//! (`transaction::verify_stream`), the scripts run: every unproven
//! transaction's inputs are executed against the parent outputs the BEEF
//! carries, and an Atomic subject is held to its rule. A valid payment is
//! never refused for its size or its counts; a refusal of the bytes names
//! the offset and the reader's kind. This crate carries no limit, no count
//! bound and no 413 (the posture of 2026-10-09, "a BEEF of any size").
//!
//! ## What the words map to (0.5.0)
//!
//! | core | adapter | a host answers |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `Verified { satoshis }` | `Ok(satoshis)` | serve |
//! | `NoHeaderService` | `Err(NoHeaderService)` | 500 `ERR_SERVER_MISCONFIGURED`: a misconfiguration, fix the deployment |
//! | `Unverifiable { reason }`, `reason.is_server_side()` (`HeaderLookupFailed`) | `Err(Unverifiable { reason })`, warning logged | 503 `ERR_HEADER_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`, the quote kept: retry the SAME payment later |
//! | `Unverifiable { reason }`, the payer's (`InvalidBeef`, `SpendRefused`, `NoProof`, `OutputMissing`, `NoTransaction`, `MalformedTransaction`, `KeyDerivation` of the sender's key) | `Err(Unverifiable { reason })` | 400 `ERR_PAYMENT_INVALID`, the quote kept: send another payment |
//! | `Underpaid { paid, required }` | `Err(Underpaid { satoshis: paid, required })` | 400 `ERR_PAYMENT_INVALID`, the quote kept |
//! | `WrongScript { expected, actual }` | `Err(WrongScript { expected, actual })` | 400 `ERR_PAYMENT_INVALID`, the quote kept |
//! | `RootMismatch { height, root }` | `Err(RootMismatch { height, root })` | 400 `ERR_PAYMENT_INVALID`: a fraud signal |
//! | `PaymentFault::KeyDerivation` (the SERVER's key) | `Err(KeyDerivation)` | 500: the host's own fault |
//!
//! [`PaymentVerifyError::is_server_side`] is the one predicate a host needs
//! for the 503 row: `true` for `Unverifiable` with a server-side reason and
//! for nothing else (`NoHeaderService` is a misconfiguration, 500, not a
//! transient 503).
//!
//! **A header lookup the service cannot answer fails closed (0.4.0).** Once
//! a header service is named, a lookup it cannot answer (unreachable, HTTP
//! error, unparseable body, height not yet indexed) leaves the root
//! unchecked, and an unchecked root is not evidence: the core answers
//! `Unverifiable` with `HeaderLookupFailed { height }` (the lowest such
//! height) and [`accept_verdict`] refuses it. 0.3.x accepted that case with a
//! logged warning; the rule adopted on 2026-10-08 ended that. The refusal is
//! the server's condition, not the client's fault: render it 503-class, keep
//! the quote, and let the client retry the same payment once the service
//! answers.
//!
//! **A missing proof is the payer's (0.5.0, ruled 2026-10-09).** A BEEF that
//! carries no BUMP, a transaction whose input names a parent the BEEF does
//! not carry, a transaction with no input (invalid bytes to the reader since
//! bsv-rs 0.4.1, `InvalidBeef` with the kind `NoInputs` at its leading byte;
//! 0.5.0 on 0.4.0 refused that shape as `NoProof`): the server never
//! fetches a missing proof; the refusal names the transaction whose proof is
//! absent, and the host answers 400 with the quote kept. A spend the script
//! interpreter refuses (`SpendRefused`) is the payer's too. Hosts that want
//! the words themselves call the core (or [`verify_brc29_payment_verdict`])
//! and match them; none of the six may be served on but `Verified`, except
//! the named opt-out's own `Unverifiable` through
//! [`verify_brc29_payment_structural_only`].
//!
//! ## Header service: required
//!
//! This crate ships **no** header service of its own, and it never skips SPV
//! silently. `header_url` must name your own ChainTracks-compatible service
//! (for example a ChainTracks deployment you run). `None`, an empty string,
//! [`DEFAULT_CHAINTRACKS_URL`], any other `.invalid` host, a value without
//! an `http://` / `https://` scheme, or a value whose host the gate cannot
//! classify as a real hostname is refused with
//! [`PaymentVerifyError::NoHeaderService`] BEFORE anything else is checked, so
//! a misconfigured deployment rejects every payment loudly instead of
//! accepting unverified ones. The host is normalised (lowercased, trailing
//! dot stripped) before the placeholder comparison, and spellings that would
//! need a URL parser to decode or rewrite (percent-encoding, backslashes,
//! userinfo, whitespace, non-ASCII) are refused rather than guessed at, so
//! no spelling of the placeholder reaches DNS and surfaces as a lookup error
//! instead of as the misconfiguration it is. Adopters that
//! truly have no header service opt out *by name* with
//! [`verify_brc29_payment_structural_only`].
//!
//! | `header_url` | outcome |
//! |---|---|
//! | `None`, `Some("")`, whitespace only | `Err(NoHeaderService)` |
//! | the `.invalid` placeholder (trailing slash or dot or not, any case), any `.invalid` host | `Err(NoHeaderService)` |
//! | no `http://` / `https://` scheme, no host | `Err(NoHeaderService)` |
//! | userinfo (`@`), `%`, `\`, whitespace, control or non-ASCII characters, a non-numeric port, a label that is not a hostname | `Err(NoHeaderService)` |
//! | service unreachable, HTTP error, unparseable answer, height not indexed | `Err(Unverifiable { reason: HeaderLookupFailed { height, .. } })`, warning logged (fail-closed; 503-class, the quote kept) |
//! | the header at that height carries a different root | `Err(RootMismatch)` (fail-closed) |
//! | the header carries the proof's root | `Ok(satoshis)` |
//!
//! The configuration gate (`resolve_header_service`) is a pure function,
//! pinned by table tests; the per-root decision is the core's
//! (`bsv_middleware_core::spv::decide_root`), pinned there.
//!
//! ## Relation to the payment middleware
//!
//! [`process_payment_with_storage`](crate::process_payment_with_storage)
//! verifies the derivation-prefix HMAC, runs the core's output check
//! (`bsv_middleware_core::verify_payment_output`: script and amount, 0.3.8)
//! on output 0 and decides its words in one match of its own
//! (`middleware::payment`; a server-side `Unverifiable` there is `503
//! ERR_HEADER_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` with the quote kept, a payer-side one
//! `400 ERR_INVALID_PAYMENT` with the quote kept), consumes the prefix
//! once, and hands the transaction to the wallet storage
//! server. The storage server's
//! `internalizeAction` checks neither the script nor the amount (the
//! reference keeps the script check in its signer, which is not on this
//! path), so the middleware's check is the only one on it. The middleware
//! does not run the reader or SPV. The full [`verify_brc29_payment`] is
//! for callers that run their **own** payment flow (a custom 402 handler, a
//! pre-charge + refund model, a non-wallet settlement path) and want, locally
//! and before any remote call, an output that pays this server's derived key,
//! carrying at least the quoted satoshis, inside a valid, spendable, proven
//! BEEF.
