# Changelog

All notable changes to `bsv-middleware-cloudflare`. Versions below 1.0 may change public API between minor versions;
patch versions are additive unless a line below says otherwise.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-08

The core extract. The rules moved to a new runtime-free crate, `bsv-middleware-core` 0.1.0 (this repository,
`core/`); this crate is now the Cloudflare Workers adapter over it. Carries everything in 0.3.7, 0.3.8 and 0.3.9.
**One breaking change, for 0.3.9 adopters only:** `PaymentVerifyError::Unverifiable` carries `{ satoshis, reason }`
here where 0.3.9 carried `{ height, reason }`; a match written against 0.3.9's fields must change (a `_` arm compiles
unchanged). Every other 0.3 public item keeps its name, path and signature (re-exported from the core where the type
moved), and the fleet's call sites compile unchanged. Versions below 1.0 may change public API between minors.

### What moved to the core (re-exported here at the 0.3 paths)

- `types::{AuthContext, PaymentContext, BsvPayment}`.
- `transport::{auth_headers, HttpRequestData, HttpResponseData}`; the request payload builder, the varint
  writer, the signable-header filters and `message_to_headers` are `bsv_middleware_core::brc104`
  (`CloudflareTransport` delegates to them).
- `middleware::session_lane` (whole; the adapter keeps the suite and `tests/fixtures/session_lane.vectors.json`).
- `refund::signer` (whole); `issue_refund` derives the client's key through `bsv_middleware_core::refund`.
- The BRC-103 sign/verify, the identity binding, the `InitialResponse` and `CertificateResponse` builders and
  response signing (`bsv_middleware_core::auth`, over a `SessionBinding`); `process_auth*`, `sign_response` and
  `sign_json_response` call them and are byte-for-byte on the wire.
- BRC-29 derivation, the output check, BEEF completeness and the SPV decision
  (`bsv_middleware_core::{brc29, spv, payment_verify}`), answered in the six words (`PaymentVerdict`).
- `PAYMENT_NONCE_SCOPE` (`bsv_middleware_core::store`).

### Added

- `UrlHeaderService`: the core's `HeaderService` over a ChainTracks-compatible base URL (Workers `fetch`), built
  only through the 0.3.6 configuration gate (`UrlHeaderService::resolve`).
- `verify_brc29_payment_verdict`: the core's `PaymentVerdict` through any `HeaderService`, for callers that
  decide the words themselves.
- `accept_verdict`: the one visible match from the core's words to `PaymentVerifyError` / `Ok(satoshis)`.
- `PaymentVerifyError::Unverifiable { satoshis, reason }`: new on this line (0.3.9 introduced it on the 0.3 line as
  `{ height, reason }`; see Changed). A host's `_` arm compiles unchanged; that arm answers the client's 400 today, so
  hosts should add a 503 arm for it (the quote kept).
- `PaymentVerifyError: From<PaymentFault>`; `AuthCloudflareError: From<bsv_middleware_core::AuthError>`.
- `SessionNonceStore(&storage)`: any `SessionStorage` as the core's `PaymentNonceStore`; `D1ClaimStore(&db)`
  (feature `d1-claims`): the D1 table as the core's `ClaimStore`.
- `bsv_middleware_cloudflare::core` (the core crate as a module) and the top-level `HeaderService`,
  `PaymentVerdict`, `PaymentFault` re-exports.
- `core/tests/conformance_brc29.rs`: the core runs the 20 vectors of `conformance/brc29-payment-vectors.json` (0.3.7)
  through its `HeaderService` trait with a stub, from its own copy of the file (`core/conformance/`, shipped in the
  core's package); the adapter's runner re-pins the root file with the 0.4.0 producer line, writes both copies on
  `emit`, and pins the core's copy byte-identical to the root one.

### Changed

Against 0.3.9 (the last release on the 0.3 line), three behaviours differ and are intended:

- `Unverifiable` carries `{ satoshis, reason }` (0.3.9: `{ height, reason }`), matching the conformance vectors as the
  vectors' owner (bsv-stack-lean) keeps them: `spv-lookup-error` expects `fields: {satoshis}`; 0.3.9's file wrote
  `{height}` and retired the glossary entry `AcceptedUnverified`, this file keeps the entry as a retired alias.
- Root precedence: the core asks the header service about every root and a mismatch at any height wins over an
  unanswered root (`RootMismatch`, 400); 0.3.9 stopped at the lowest height that did not match, so a lookup error at
  a low height answered `Unverifiable` (503) even when a higher root was wrong. A lookup error cannot mask fraud here.
- Underpaid / WrongScript on the middleware's own payment path answer 400 `ERR_INVALID_PAYMENT` with the quote kept
  (0.3.8 and 0.3.9 answered 402 with a fresh challenge); reference parity with the Express payment middleware.

- **A header lookup the service cannot answer fails closed.** 0.3.x accepted a payment whose merkle root could not be
  checked (service unreachable, HTTP error, unparseable answer, height not yet indexed) with a logged warning; 0.4.0
  refuses it, by the project's ruling of 2026-10-08: a root that was not checked against a block header is not
  evidence. `accept_verdict`, and with it `verify_brc29_payment`, `verify_brc29_payment_with_header_lookup` and
  `verify_brc29_payment_verdict`'s callers that use it, answer `Err(PaymentVerifyError::Unverifiable { satoshis,
  reason })` where 0.3.x answered `Ok(satoshis)`, so no host serves on it by accident. On the middleware's own path
  (`process_payment_with_storage`, `process_payment_with_storage_signed`, the deprecated `process_payment`) the word
  is `503 ERR_HEADER_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` with the quote kept: a transient server-side condition (nothing charged, the
  prefix not consumed, no fresh challenge, the wallet not called; the client retries the same payment later),
  distinct from `500 ERR_SERVER_MISCONFIGURED` for `NoHeaderService` and from the 400s for a payment that is wrong
  (`Underpaid`, `WrongScript`, `RootMismatch`, a `PaymentFault`). The one function that still answers `Ok` with roots
  unchecked is the named opt-out `verify_brc29_payment_structural_only`, because its caller asked for that by name;
  it no longer goes through `accept_verdict` for that word. The conformance file's `spv-lookup-error` case expects
  `Unverifiable`, refused, and carries the ruling in its `rulings` list. Hosts that run their own payment flow
  through `verify_brc29_payment` should render the new variant 503-class (today a two-arm match answers 400).
- **A short or misdirected payment on the middleware's own path is refused with `400 ERR_INVALID_PAYMENT` and the
  quote is kept** (`process_payment_with_storage`, `process_payment_with_storage_signed`, the deprecated
  `process_payment`; the core's `Underpaid` / `WrongScript` on output 0). 0.3.8 answered `402 ERR_INVALID_PAYMENT`
  with a fresh challenge. Now: no fresh challenge, the derivation prefix not consumed, the wallet not called, and the
  body says the challenge is unchanged, so an honest client corrects the payment and retries under the same prefix.
  Why: the Express reference (`payment-express-middleware`) answers 400 for every refusal after the challenge and
  reserves 402 for "pay now"; a 402 re-arms automated payers (AuthFetch-class clients) into a second payment for the
  same request while the first sits un-internalized; one live quote per request keeps the single-use rule simple;
  and existing hosts built on this crate's `verify_brc29_payment` already answer 400 and keep the quote. `NoHeaderService` stays `500 ERR_SERVER_MISCONFIGURED`,
  `RootMismatch` and a `PaymentFault` `400 ERR_INVALID_PAYMENT`, `Unverifiable` `503 ERR_HEADER_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`
  (above). The words did not change; the HTTP rendering of three of them did, and one case's expected word
  (`spv-lookup-error`) changed with the ruling.

### Behaviour

- Unchanged on the wire, except the two refusals under Changed. The verdict mapping is documented in
  `payment_verify`: `Verified` is the only `Ok(satoshis)`; every other word is the same-named `Err`, `Unverifiable`
  included (**fail-closed**, with the reason logged).
- `verify_brc29_payment_structural_only` answers through the core's `Unverifiable` word when a proof carries
  roots and serves it with the warning logged, as 0.3.6 did: the named opt-out is the one place that may.
- **The middleware's own payment path decides from the core's words.** `process_payment_with_storage`,
  `process_payment_with_storage_signed` and the deprecated `process_payment` run the core's output check
  (`bsv_middleware_core::verify_payment_output`) on output 0 and match its `PaymentVerdict` once
  (`judge_paying_output`): `Verified` serves and records the amount read; `Underpaid` / `WrongScript` are
  `400 ERR_INVALID_PAYMENT` with the quote kept (the prefix not consumed, no fresh challenge, the wallet not called;
  see Changed); a `PaymentFault` or `RootMismatch` is `400 ERR_INVALID_PAYMENT`, the prefix kept; `NoHeaderService` is
  `500 ERR_SERVER_MISCONFIGURED` (the server's own fault, never a client error); `Unverifiable` is
  `503 ERR_HEADER_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`, the quote kept (refused, fail-closed; see Changed). Only `Verified` serves.
  The output check answers three of the six words today: this path
  runs no SPV (no merkle proof is checked against a header; what the wallet storage server does on
  `internalizeAction` is not verified by this crate, and `verify_brc29_payment` is the caller's proof step before
  the middleware); the other arms are the path's standing answer should the check grow a proof step. Every payment
  0.3.8 served is served, with the same `satoshis_paid`; the one wire answer that changed is the refusal under
  Changed.

### Tests

- 0.3.8 baseline: 212 unit + 2 conformance-file tests. 0.4.0: adapter 220 unit + 4 conformance-file tests (the
  runner, the pinned bytes, the core's copy, the ruling; the emitter is ignored); core 89 unit (82 without `refund`)
  + 3 conformance. 23 test paths moved from the adapter to the core, none lost. Both runners check the outcome as
  well as the word: only `Verified` serves.

### Known

- Error-code spelling: hosts that run their own payment flow through `verify_brc29_payment` have answered
  `ERR_PAYMENT_INVALID` for a refused payment; this crate and the Express reference spell it `ERR_INVALID_PAYMENT`.
  The Express spelling is the one to keep; aligning the hosts (or documenting the alias) is a later release.
- Hosts on a two-arm match (`NoHeaderService` → 500, `_` → 400) render the new `PaymentVerifyError::Unverifiable`
  as the client's 400 today; the intended answer is 503-class with the quote kept, so the client retries the same
  payment. The hosts' change, not this crate's.
- The conformance file's `words` glossary still spells `Unverifiable` by its retired name `AcceptedUnverified`, and
  the ruled case's `expected.fields` carry that word's `satoshis`; both are the file owner's to change in a reviewed
  diff. This crate's copy differs from the owner's in the `producer` line, the ruling's `why` (public wording) and,
  on the ruled case, `crate_result` and `note` (this crate's own answer, now a refusal).
- `HeaderService::merkle_root` and the core's store traits return `impl Future` without a `Send` bound, by design
  for wasm32. A host on a multi-threaded runtime needs its own implementations' futures to be `Send`; the verifier
  is generic over the service, so that works, but it is the host's obligation and the core README will say so
  before a native host adopts the trait.

### Removed from the dependency list

- `hmac` and `ripemd` (they moved with the lane and the signer; `sha2` stays for the Durable Object cell).

## 0.3.9 — 2026-10-08 (0.3 line, branch `release-0.3`, tag `v0.3.9`)

- Fails closed on a header-service lookup error: `verify_brc29_payment` (and the `_with_header_lookup` form) return
  `Err(PaymentVerifyError::Unverifiable { height, reason })` instead of accepting with a warning; the middleware's own
  payment path answers 503 `ERR_HEADER_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` with the quote kept (prefix not consumed, wallet not
  called). The owner's ruling of 2026-10-08. The conformance file's `spv-lookup-error` case expects `Unverifiable`.
- No other change: 0.3.8's 402-with-a-fresh-challenge on Underpaid / WrongScript stays on this line.

## 0.3.8 — 2026-10-08

### Fixed

- **The middleware's own payment flow reads the paying output** (P0-3b). `process_payment_with_storage`,
  `process_payment_with_storage_signed` and the deprecated `process_payment` now run `verify_brc29_payment_output` on
  output 0 before the derivation prefix is consumed and before `internalizeAction`. Until now nothing on this path
  compared the output with the price or checked that it pays this server's BRC-29 derived key; the storage server
  checks neither, so an underpaid payment, or one paying another key, was served. 0.3.7 shipped the conformance
  vectors without this wiring.

### Behaviour

- A payment whose output 0 carries less than the price, or is not locked to the server's derived key for (prefix,
  suffix, the authenticated identity), is refused with `402 ERR_INVALID_PAYMENT` and a fresh challenge; the storage
  is not called and the prefix is not consumed, so the client may retry it.
- An unreadable payment transaction, or one with no output 0, is refused with `400 ERR_INVALID_PAYMENT`; the prefix
  is not consumed.
- `PaymentContext::satoshis_paid` (and so `x-bsv-payment-satoshis-paid`) is the amount read from output 0, not the
  price: an overpayment records what was paid.
- The middleware does not run BEEF structure or SPV (`verify_brc29_payment` stays the caller's choice).
- Exact-price payers to the key derived from the same `server_private_key` see no change. A deployment whose payment
  key differs from the key its clients derive for will now be refused instead of recording outputs it cannot spend.

## 0.3.7 — 2026-10-08

### Added

- `verify_brc29_payment_with_header_lookup`: `verify_brc29_payment` with the header lookup supplied by the caller
  (`Fn(height) -> Future<Result<merkle_root, reason>>`) instead of a `header_url`; same fail-closed mismatch,
  fail-open service error (0.4.0 fails closed on it; see 0.4.0 Changed). For a service binding, a cached header
  store, or a conformance runner.
- `conformance/brc29-payment-vectors.json` + `conformance/README.md`: 20 implementation-neutral BRC-29 payment
  verification vectors (amount, script, first-output rule, pay-yourself, header-service gate, SPV), produced and run
  by `tests/conformance_brc29.rs`. A second implementation runs the same file. No behaviour or signature changes.

## 0.3.6 — 2026-10-08

### Added

- `payment_verify`: `expected_brc29_locking_script`, `verify_brc29_payment_output` (script + amount, sync) and
  `verify_brc29_payment` (adds BEEF structural completeness and SPV against a header service you run), for callers
  that run their own payment flow and want the pays-us-correctly and real-and-confirmable checks before
  `internalizeAction`.
- `verify_brc29_payment_structural_only`: the same offline checks with **no SPV**, for adopters that have no header
  service. Opt-in by name; a warning is logged whenever merkle roots go unchecked.
- `PaymentVerifyError::NoHeaderService`.
- Feature `d1-claims`: `claim_payment_nonce` / `release_payment_nonce`, an atomic single-use payment-nonce claim on a
  D1 table (`PAYMENT_CLAIMS_SCHEMA`), for callers outside the stock middleware or on the eventually-consistent KV
  backend.
- docs.rs builds with all features.

### Behaviour

- **A header service URL is required for `verify_brc29_payment`.** `header_url = None`, `Some("")`, the
  `DEFAULT_CHAINTRACKS_URL` `.invalid` placeholder (in any case, with or without a trailing slash or dot), any other
  `.invalid` host, a value without an `http(s)://` scheme, or a value whose host the gate cannot classify as a real
  hostname (userinfo, percent-encoding, backslashes, whitespace, non-ASCII, a non-numeric port) returns
  `Err(NoHeaderService)` before any other check. The host is normalised before the placeholder comparison, so no
  spelling of the placeholder slips through to DNS and fails open. SPV is never skipped
  silently. Once a service is named, a service error (unreachable, HTTP error, unparseable answer) still fails open
  with a logged warning (until 0.3.8; 0.4.0 fails closed on it, see 0.4.0 Changed), and a merkle root that differs
  from the block header still fails closed with `RootMismatch`.
- The configuration gate and the per-root SPV decision are pure functions with table tests (match, mismatch, lookup
  error, and every refused `header_url` shape); the header lookup is injected into the loop that runs them.

## 0.3.5 — 2026-09-20

Session-lane hardening; no new API.

- The lane's replay window rides across the Durable Object store as a decimal string, and a laned counter above
  `MAX_SAFE_COUNTER` (2^53 − 1) is refused by name instead of faulting the store.
- Every 64-bit field of the session cell and its body types documents its bound.

## 0.3.4 — 2026-09-14

- **Session lane (opt-in).** One BRC-103/104 handshake per origin, then MAC'd calls with no wallet calls and one
  Durable Object round trip: `process_auth_lane`, `LaneAuthResult`, `seal_lane_response` / `seal_lane_response_text`,
  `request_presents_lane`, the `x-bsv-lane-offer` header on the first signed general message that asks, and the pure
  rules in `middleware::session_lane`. The MAC vectors are `tests/fixtures/session_lane.vectors.json`, sha256-pinned.
- `mint_attested_lane`: a lane for an identity a first-party authority has proven, with the same record and lifetime
  as the signed-read mint.
- `sha2` is a plain dependency (the lane MACs); `ripemd` stays behind `refund`.

## 0.3.3 — 2026-09-09

- **Durable Object session backend (opt-in).** `process_auth_do`, `AuthSessionStore`, `DoSessionStorage`: one object
  per session nonce holds the session record and the consumed per-request nonces (an atomic put-if-absent, no KV
  write per request); KV stays the cold path.
- `SessionStorage::get_session_and_consume`: the hot path in one round trip, as an additive trait default
  ("unsupported") that every existing backend keeps.
