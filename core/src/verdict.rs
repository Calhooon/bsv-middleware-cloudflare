//! The words a BRC-29 payment check answers with: one enum, no booleans.

//! boolean, fails closed without a header service, and never serves on a
//! root it could not check.
//!
//! A host collapses the words to "serve" or "refuse" in ONE visible match.
//! Only [`PaymentVerdict::Verified`] serves. [`PaymentVerdict::NoHeaderService`]
//! is the server's own fault and is answered as a 5xx, never as a client
//! error. [`PaymentVerdict::Unverifiable`] is a refusal too, and its
//! [`UnverifiableReason`] says whose side it is on
//! ([`UnverifiableReason::is_server_side`]): a header lookup the service
//! could not answer is the server's (a 5xx of its own, the quote kept, the
//! same payment retried later: the ruling of 2026-10-08); invalid bytes, a
//! spend the interpreter refuses, a missing output, a key that does not
//! derive and a proof that is absent are the payer's (a 4xx, no fields: the
//! ruling of 2026-10-09 on the no-root class). The core never serves on it,
//! and neither may a host.
//!
//! No word and no reason is a size or a count: a valid payment of any size
//! is read, and a refusal is for invalid bytes only, named by offset and
//! kind (the posture of 2026-10-09, "a BEEF of any size").
