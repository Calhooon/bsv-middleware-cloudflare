//! BRC-29 payment verification before internalize: pays-us-correctly
//! **and** real-and-confirmable, answered in the six words.
//!
//! # A payment of any size
//!
//! A valid payment is never refused for its size or its counts (the ruling
//! of 2026-10-09, "a BEEF of any size"). The payment is read ONCE through
//! the streaming reader of bsv-rs 0.4 (0.4.1 at least)
//! ([`bsv_sdk::transaction::verify_stream`]): the reader holds one element
//! of the BEEF and its index, never the BEEF; a tap beside it notes the
//! subject's output as the bytes pass. A refusal of the bytes names the
//! offset and one of the reader's eighteen kinds
//! ([`UnverifiableReason::InvalidBeef`]), none of which is a size or a
//! count. This module carries no bound and exports none. (The bytes are
//! held in hand by the caller in this release; a host that streams a
//! request body through the same checks is the next one.)
//!
//! # Order of checks ([`verify_brc29_payment`])
//!
//! 0. a header service is configured, else
//!    [`NoHeaderService`](PaymentVerdict::NoHeaderService), before the bytes
//!    are read, so a deployment with no header service never looks like one
//!    that verifies; the server's key derives, else `Err(PaymentFault)`
//!    (the host's own fault); the sender's key derives, else
//!    [`Unverifiable`](PaymentVerdict::Unverifiable)
//!    ([`KeyDerivation`](UnverifiableReason::KeyDerivation), the payer's);
//! 1. the bytes are a valid BEEF (V1, V2 or Atomic) by the streaming
//!    reader, with the scripts run: the frame, every BUMP's own root, every
//!    unproven transaction's inputs naming earlier transactions and
//!    SPENDING them (the interpreter executes each unlocking script against
//!    the parent output the BEEF carries, and no transaction creates
//!    value), the Atomic subject the tip of its ancestry; else
//!    `Unverifiable` at the soonest fault in stream order
//!    ([`InvalidBeef`](UnverifiableReason::InvalidBeef),
//!    [`SpendRefused`](UnverifiableReason::SpendRefused));
//! 2. the subject (the Atomic BEEF's named transaction, else the last raw
//!    transaction) has output `output_index`, else `Unverifiable`
//!    ([`OutputMissing`](UnverifiableReason::OutputMissing)); the output's
//!    script equals the expected BRC-29 script, else
//!    [`WrongScript`](PaymentVerdict::WrongScript); its satoshis are at
//!    least the price, else [`Underpaid`](PaymentVerdict::Underpaid);
//! 3. the BEEF carries a proof (so every ancestry ends at a proven
//!    transaction: the reader holds every unproven transaction to an input,
//!    a transaction with no input being invalid bytes since bsv-rs 0.4.1,
//!    `InvalidBeef` with the kind `NoInputs`), else `Unverifiable`
//!    ([`NoProof`](UnverifiableReason::NoProof), naming the transaction
//!    whose proof is absent: the payer's side, ruled 2026-10-09; the server
//!    never fetches a missing proof);
//! 4. every merkle root the BUMPs compute, lowest height first, each
//!    distinct root once, is the [`HeaderService`]'s root at that height
//!    (case-insensitive hex): a different root is
//!    [`RootMismatch`](PaymentVerdict::RootMismatch); a lookup that cannot
//!    answer is `Unverifiable`
//!    ([`HeaderLookupFailed`](UnverifiableReason::HeaderLookupFailed) at the
//!    lowest such height: the server's side, fail closed, the quote kept;
//!    a mismatch at any height still wins over an outage at another);
//! 5. [`Verified`](PaymentVerdict::Verified), the amount read from the
//!    output ([`verify_brc29_payment_verified`] also hands back the subject's
//!    txid as the reader hashed it).
//!
//! The roots are asked AFTER the output is judged (no header is asked for a
//! payment the output already refuses), so the reader runs with every root
//! granted (`RootsAskedAfter`) and step 4 is where a root is held to a
//! header: nothing is `Verified` with a root unchecked.
//!
//! [`verify_brc29_payment_structural_only`] is the named opt-out: the
//! reader's structure alone (no script is run), the output, the proof's
//! presence; the roots are NOT asked, and the answer is `Unverifiable`
//! ([`RootsUnchecked`](UnverifiableReason::RootsUnchecked), carrying the
//! amount) so the skip stays visible in the word. That is the one
//! `Unverifiable` a host may serve on, and only because its caller named
//! the opt-out; through [`verify_brc29_payment`] the word is always a
//! refusal.
